### About me
- 📚 Currently working with React and TypeScript.
- 💼 4+ years of experience in developing desktop and mobile applications for automating business processes.
- 🏡 Living in Tampere since 2022, originally from Russia.
- 💬 I speak English.

### Some of my projects that showcase my skills
- <a href="https://github.com/nvdovenko/nord">NORD</a> - my latest project currently in development: an online store built with React and Web Components. It features a dynamic cart with localStorage and custom elements. Future plans include adding a backend with databases to support user accounts, orders, and inventory management.
- <a href="https://github.com/Ennendra/MyRecipeBook">MyRecipeBook</a>  a single-page web application where I, along with two talented software developers, demonstrated our skills in web programming and team collaboration.
If you're interested in my front-end skills, feel free to check it out.
- My own small <a href="https://github.com/nvdovenko/Storybook">Storybook</a> with React components and other features.
- <a href="https://github.com/nvdovenko/ToDo-List-">ToDo List</a>   – a simple to-do list application with a clean, minimalist interface. I developed this app when I was just starting to learn TypeScript and React, but I believe it showcases my approach to work.
