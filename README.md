### About me
- 📚 Currently learning React and TypeScript.
- 💼 4+ years of experience in developing desktop and mobile applications for automating business processes.
- 🏡 Living in Tampere since 2022, originally from Russia.
- 💬 I speak English.

### Some of my projects that showcase my skills
- <a href="https://github.com/Ennendra/MyRecipeBook">MyRecipeBook</a>  a single-page web application where I, along with two talented software developers, demonstrated our skills in web programming and team collaboration.
If you're interested in my front-end skills, feel free to check it out.
- <a href="https://github.com/nvdovenko/ToDo-List-">ToDo List</a>  a simple Todo List application with a clean, minimalist interface built with React and TypeScript.
This app is small, but I'm finding TypeScript really challanging because I'm still learning it.
- I'm currently developing my own <a href="https://github.com/nvdovenko/Storybook">Storybook</a> with React components and other features. Still in progress, which is why it isn't deployed on GitHub Pages yet.
